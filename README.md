Coursera Data Products Assignment

For this assignment I created a data product using shiny. The was provided from the fastfoodnutrition.org website. The data product is designed to encourage users to become more health conscious providing the user with information on the nutritional contents for different foods from 15 fast food franchises.

This will help users measure their nutritional intake and give them a good estimate on how much exercise is required to burn off a meal.

Please find the Shiny application in the following link:
